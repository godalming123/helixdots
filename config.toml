# Explanation:
# - The `@` makes this [a macro keybinding](https://helix-editor.com/news/release-25-01-highlights/#macro-keybindings)
# - The 1st line saves the current cursor position to the jumplist, so it can be restored later
# - The 2nd line removes all charecters in the table header that are not `|`
# - The 3rd line inserts ` - ` before every `|` charecter in the table header
# - The 4rd line removes all the spacing between the end of the contents in a table row, and the  `|`
# - The 5th line aligns the table columns
# - The 6th line replaces the spaces in the table header with dashes
# - The 7th line jumps backwards in the jumplist to restore the cursor position

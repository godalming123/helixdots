# HelixDots
My helix editor dotfiles.
## My thoughs on helix
### General
 - In helix I have to type more letters but the command is more memorable EG: vgld in helix vs D in neovim
 - I like how everything needs much less configuration as things such as git integration are setup out of the box
 - It feels like my editor is helping me as I go like autosuggesting commands
### Appereance
 - The file picker does not have rounded corners
 - Git signs looks much nicer
 - Status bar looks nicer
 - Helix includes good themes out of the box
 - I like how LSP diagnostics are placed in the top right corner making them much easier to see
### Writing text
 - I think that the LSP and treesitter is slightly better but I need to use helix for longer to see
### Editing text
 - I like being able to use x and X to quickly make visual line selections
 - Using find and replace is much easier as helix shows me exactly what I'm doing as I do it
### Navigating text
 - I think both helix and neovim do a good job of this
### Missing some functionality
 - I cannot set global tab options (see https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/3159)
 - No git diff viewer integration (see https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/227)
 - When commands ran with sh return long outputs they cannot be scrolled (I would not need this if the above issue is resolved)
 - I cannot have an undotree
 - No moving selected up/down (see https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/2245)
 - You cannot remove/clear the jumplist so it just slowly get clogged up (see https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/4757)
 - I would like to be able to install LSP's automatically (see https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/2152)

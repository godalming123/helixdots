# HelixDots
My helix editor dotfiles.
## My thoughs on helix
### General
- I like how everything needs much less configuration as things such as git integration are setup out of the box
- It feels like my editor is helping me as I go like autosuggesting commands
- In helix I have to type more letters but the command is more memorable EG: vgld in helix vs D in neovim
### Appereance
- The file picker does not have rounded corners
- Git signs looks much nicer
- Status bar looks nicer
- Helix includes good themes out of the box
- I like how LSP diagnostics are placed in the top right corner making them much easier to see
### Writing text
- I think that the LSP is slightly better but I need to use helix for longer to see
### Editing text
- I like being able to use x and X to quickly make visual line selections
- Using find and replace is much easier as helix shows me exactly what I'm doing as I do it and I generally love using multiple cursors
### Navigating text
- I think both helix and neovim do a good job of this
### Missing some functionality
- I cannot set global tab size options (see https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/3159)
- No git diff viewer integration (see https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/227)
- When commands ran with sh return long outputs they cannot be scrolled (I would not need this if the above issue is resolved)
- I cannot have an undotree
- No moving selected up/down (see https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/2245)
- You can only add to the jump list or clear it by exiting helix (see https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/4757)
- There is no file tree
- When you search for things helix should show how many results their are (see https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/2811)
- There should be an error when formatting fails (see https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/6736)
